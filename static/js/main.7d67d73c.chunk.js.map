Currently, she enjoys exploring new ways to approach art through diverse means such as coding, 3D modeling, web designing, and creating digital image compositions. With artistic exploration and experimentation, Cindy aspires to learn and expand her creations beyond mundane and conventional means. She believes that art reaches far beyond a flat canvas, holding universal truths, and ignites immersive and interactive experiences that simply cannot be defined in a singular form.`}/>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <Footer/>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Forms;","import  Navbar  from './Navbar'\r\nimport './css/Forms.css';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport  Footer  from './Footer'\r\n\r\nfunction Forms() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"forms-page\">\r\n      <Navbar/>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"forms-intro\">\r\n        <h1>This is the Forms page intro portion</h1>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"forms-body\">\r\n        <h2>Body of Forms page</h2>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <Footer/>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Forms;","import  Navbar  from './Navbar'\r\nimport './css/FAQ.css';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport  Footer  from './Footer'\r\nimport codeConduct from './cadre_mentorship_code_of_conduct.pdf';\r\n\r\nfunction FAQ() {\r\n  function scrollTo(id){\r\n    if(document.querySelector(id)){\r\n      document.querySelector(id).scrollIntoView();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"faq-page\">\r\n      <Navbar/>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"faq-intro\">\r\n        <div className=\"faq-hero\">\r\n          <a href=\"https://cadrementorship.github.io/showcase-f20/teams/catson.html\">\r\n            <img className=\"faq-hero-img\" src=\"images/hero-img/LayWithMeBeneaththeGeminiSky.jpg\"/>\r\n            <p className=\"faq-hero-text\">Lay With Me Beneath the Gemini Sky, Catherine Thy Le &amp;
