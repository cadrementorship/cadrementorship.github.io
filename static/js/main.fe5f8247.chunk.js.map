Art has helped me gain insight about the world and myself. A lot of my inspiration comes from digital artists, nostalgia, film, video games, and pop culture. When I consume things, I like to remix it to form my interpretation. Digital artists Jonathan Zawada, Quentin Deronzier, and Kim Laughton influence my works because it looks dreamlike, whimsical, and odd, transporting the viewer to an unfamiliar world, but at the same brings out familiarness. It inspires me to create art and reflect that in my own style and works. My current work explores the relationship between digital technology and culture along with the psychological effects it has on us, especially with this odd transition between the old world and new technology.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"people-body-card\">\r\n            <div className=\"people-body-card-img\">\r\n              <img src=\"https://dummyimage.com/150x150.jpg\"/>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p className=\"people-body-card-name\" href=\"https://asokry.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Jordan Hoekwater</p>\r\n            <p className=\"people-body-card-text\">My work as an artist explores the multi-fascinated manipulation of art processes in multimedia.

The uniqueness of my practice is highlighted through extracting and taking advantage of these technological advances to create my own narrative that will capture and engage the viewers.  My practice has taught me how to be patient with myself and my work and not everything is going to work in my favor because I am working with a machine.  As a digital media artist, it forced me to be more flexible and be able to adapt in situations where things can become finicky, and overcoming situations like that inspires me to push myself and motivates me to work harder in my future works.   It is important to me because it makes me who I am as a person that is extremely passionate about the creation and the process of my work.  The medium I mainly focus on is digital paintings, but I am passionate about other mediums as well such as video, photo, physical painting, and drawing.  MAYA is a great 3D program that I was fortunate to learn because of the overwhelming amount of fantastic features that it offers in order to create awesome 3D models and later animating them.  This was a great opportunity to showcase my creative skills because I do not have any experience with 3D and I have always worked with 2D</p>\r\n          </div>          \r\n          \r\n          <div className=\"people-body-card\">\r\n            <div className=\"people-body-card-img\">\r\n              <img src=\"images/cole.PNG\"/>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p className=\"people-body-card-name\" href=\"https://asokry.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Cole Pergerson</p>\r\n            <p className=\"people-body-card-text\">Cole Pergerson creates computer games that tell stories through gameplay and engages the player with thoughtful challenges.

Virtual gardener has been a term he has floated around for awhile, and understanding his self more through the expression of 3D generated environments. This practice has blurred into the real world where images, objects, nature, and commodities can be transferred back and forth between virtual and physical realities. The power to transport viewers to other realities, social, visual, and experimental has captivated the artist over his life time. During his artistic practice and time behind the screen, nature has appeared to be a reoccurring motif, a sort of call back to nature from this constant cycle of \"working to live\", or better put \"live to work\". Digital art and technologies allow us to better understand ourselves, connect, and learn in this modern era to see what is beyond the flat screen. Tyler hopes to provoke engagement and curiosity in his work to evoke the desire to create and learn more. </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"people-body-card\">\r\n            <div className=\"people-body-card-img\">\r\n              <img src=\"https://dummyimage.com/150x150.jpg\"/>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p className=\"people-body-card-name\" href=\"https://asokry.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Laurie Takeda</p>\r\n            <p className=\"people-body-card-text\">My work reflects the way I perceive the world through the digital medium of videography and photography. It's informed by different destinations and personal experiences during my lifetime filtered through expression. I attempt to contemplate on different perspectives, focusing on how conceptually, everything that's built upon the foundation of the earth can be made into art. I’m inspired by those that I interact with, or the essence of a destination. I gather content through videos of friends while we hang out, or creating montages of places that I've traveled to with family, capturing candid moments and movements of the subject at hand. Conceptually, I think about the interchangeable thoughts of media through photography and videography from different environments and subjects that are presented through the livelihood of a person. Photography and videography allow for further interpretation of scenes that are placed before the viewer and myself as an artist. I've been inspired by Andy To, a videographer/photographer from Oakland, who creates cinematic content from the places that he has travelled to through the lens of a camera, both with creating a space where the viewer feels as if they’re experiencing the space as if they’re actually there, and through the aesthetics of how the pieces are put together as a whole. From my work, I want the viewers to be able to make connections to their own lives, experiencing the work as if they’re physically in that space, and seeing my art as a way to open their minds to other perspectives and insight towards life.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"people-body-card\">\r\n            <div className=\"people-body-card-img\">\r\n              <img src=\"https://dummyimage.com/150x150.jpg\"/>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p className=\"people-body-card-name\" href=\"https://asokry.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Heru Wang</p>\r\n            <p className=\"people-body-card-text\">I am a multidisciplinary artist using a variety of tools to tell stories on digital platforms. My practices involve using Adobe Creative Suites, Maya and coding to express emotions that resonate with the audience. I draw inspiration from people around me who struggle with anxiety; my work provides a space for these people struggling with fast paced life. I use images and virtual reality environments to bring emotions to life virtually and communicate with my audience through interactions. Many stories and imaginations are hard to describe with words or other mediums. However, through technology and digital formats, stories become more vivid and deliverable. By enabling interaction, users are able to explore and find the clues by themselves. <br></br>Making VR scene is a new adventure to me that contains excitement, hardships, and victory. Even though my experience with A-frame and three.js is quite new, I tried to make every piece of my idea come true despite how hard it is to develop on A-frame. Doing countless research on different three.js libraries and carefully arranging the scene in A-Frame are valuable moments to me since it helps me to learn things quickly and defeat problems without doubts. This working pattern of solving problems keeps my skills fresh and my mind sharp.<br></br>My momentum of making art comes from my desire of connecting with others and helping others.

She is comfortable using Abode software such as Photoshop and Premiere, the Sony Vegas series, and Procreate. Her line of works can be considered ironic, niche, and questionable. The goal of all her creations is to examine American beliefs and provide socio-economic commentary in a humorous manner. Alyssa proposes the questions, \"Is technology really ruining our lives?

It was the help of her mother that she grew a passion for art. When Cameron was a little girl, she experimented with different extracurricular activities and found that the activities that represented creative expression is what resonated with her the most. She found herself loving to draw even though she thought everything she drew was ugly. It was not until high school that she truly understood what kind of artist she wanted to be. She is constantly exploring her style and changing her taste. Cameron believes that change is the only way to develop and evolve as an artist and seeks to learn something new every day.
