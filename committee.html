					<h1>Yeab Kebede</h1>
					<h3>Digital Media Art <br>1st year</h3>
					<p>
						Born and raised in a country which embraces the dynamic of colors, patterns and magical folk stories, I am subconsciously attracted to colorful textiles and patterns. As a young child walking through the streets of Ethiopia, I remember that the colors not only had a life of their own but had a distinct smell. As a multi-medium artist I am inspired by my early on relationship with colors and patterns in addition to life itself. I use a wide array of means from traditional painting and drawing to more moderns was like illustration, video, photography and digital media art.

						Sophia's work's purpose is to create a bridge, between the real world and the world of her imagination.  Sophia has struggled since birth with finding a means of communication between the two worlds due to several learning disabilities. Through art she is able to communicate without any boundaries, creating a safe place for self expression. From a young age she was told she couldnâ€™t at every new venture. Sophia now strives to not only show that she can but, to show that she can flourish, proving that she is not defined by her disability. Through art she is able to communicate without any boundaries, expressing the real unaltered force behind her art.
